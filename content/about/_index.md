heading : "Junior Ux Designer"
description : "I started to learn web design about 2 years ago. First I completed a basic web designer course in a local educational institution and after that I'm started to learn from online resources for example Udemy.com and other self education sources, to get to know up-to-date technologies. 
Mainly I'm interested in UX design, but I also started learn HTML and CSS and practicing sitebuilding to really understand how applications UI builds up which I design and prototype in Adobe XD or Figma. I use Bulma as a frontend framework, and I'm started to use Zeplin for my works too.

I'm working on a high traffic (it has about 50 million visitors per day) tube website and mobile applications UX design, but I have quite a lot practice projects too."
